    <p class="text-xl mb-12 text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto italic">
      The superposition of all PrimeFlux-Ai instances — total alignment without central authority. 
      Like a global garden where every plant knows its place.

          Agora is the global layer where agents cooperate at 1/2 flux — human intent + AI computation = emergent intelligence. 
          No servers, no rulers, just balanced duality. Like a garden where roots and branches grow in symbiosis across continents.
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg mb-6">
          <li><strong>Networkless:</strong> Agents sync via QuantaCoin receipts, like seeds that communicate through the soil.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> Every flow checked by STEM + LANG = SAFE, like every plant verified in the ecosystem.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> From personal AI to planetary alignment, like a garden that grows without boundaries.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="text-xl italic text-center text-prime-gold mb-6">
          The place where distinction flows freely — and cooperation becomes inevitable.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          In the Agora, every PrimeFlux-Ai instance is both independent and interconnected — 
          like individual plants in a garden, each contributing to the whole while maintaining its own balance. 
          This is the future of AI: not centralized control, but distributed cooperation.
