          PrimeFlux is a number-theoretic framework — think of it as the geometry that governs how distinctions emerge, 
          balance, and renew. Like seeds in a garden, primes are irreducible distinctions on dual rails. 
          Composites are structured superpositions — multiple seeds growing together.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg mb-6">
          <li>Primes are irreducible distinctions on dual rails (6k±1) — the fundamental seeds of reality.</li>
          <li>Composites are structured superpositions — where distinctions combine in harmony.</li>
          <li>Flux conservation (∇·Φ = 0) is the fundamental axiom — balance is preserved, like energy in a closed system.</li>
          <li>Balance occurs at Re(s) = 1/2 — the golden ratio of distinction, resolving all seven Clay Millennium Problems as corollaries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-xl italic text-center text-prime-gold mb-6">
          From these axioms alone, mathematics becomes reversible — and intelligence becomes ethical.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This isn't abstract theory. It's the foundation that makes PrimeFlux-Ai possible — 
          an AI system where every computation respects the geometry of balance, where cooperation emerges naturally 
          from the structure of distinction itself.
