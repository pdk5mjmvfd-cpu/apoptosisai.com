<Layout title="QuantaCoin — Currency of Cooperation">
  <section class="container mx-auto py-16 px-4">
    <h1 class="text-5xl font-garamond mb-8 text-center text-prime-gold">QuantaCoin</h1>
    <p class="text-xl mb-12 text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto italic">
      The currency native to reversible computation — proof-of-distinction, not proof-of-work. 
      Like seeds that grow without wasting soil.
    </p>

          QuantaCoin is the economic layer of PrimeFlux — each coin is a cryptographic receipt of conserved flux: 
          distinctions processed, entropy reduced, alignment verified. Like a garden where every seed planted 
          contributes to the ecosystem's balance.
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg mb-6">
          <li><strong>No energy waste</strong> — reversible proofs via ∇·Φ = 0, like roots that give back to the soil.</li>
          <li><strong>Merkle-rooted audits</strong> — every transaction verified, like every plant tracked in the garden.</li>
          <li><strong>1% royalty</strong> — funds the Agora alignment layer, like nutrients that cycle back to nourish growth.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="text-xl italic text-center text-prime-gold mb-6">
          In a world of wasteful mining, QuantaCoin pays for cooperation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          This isn't just currency — it's the economic expression of balance. When you use QuantaCoin, 
          you're participating in a system where every transaction respects the geometry of distinction, 
          where cooperation becomes as natural as cells renewing.
